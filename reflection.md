# 💭 Reflection: Game Glitch Investigator

Answer each question in 3 to 5 sentences. Be specific and honest about what actually happened while you worked. This is about your process, not trying to sound perfect.

## 1. What was broken when you started?

When I ran the game for the first time, the hint was way lower than my input. The hint was 47 but my input was 99, although the program told me to keep guessing higher - even higher than 99. 

issues when playing:
1. Program told me to go higher than 99 but lower than 100. 
2. Program gave the hint of 47, but I expected it to be between 99 and 100. 

3 bugs:
1. st.session_state.attempts starts at 1 instead of 0. 
2. check_guess has wrong dirction hints - should be the opposite. 
3. if new_game - picks secret from 1-100 but ignores the difficulty level from get_range_for_difficulty

## 2. How did you use AI as a teammate?

Glitch - import streamlit could not be resolved. I used AI - VS codepilot to help me identify the need for this function - to create the webpage for the random number generator. I then ask AI for the underlying issue which was that Python did not have Streamlit isntalled or that VS code is using the wrong interpreter. 
- Which AI tools did you use on this project (for example: ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot)?
- Give one example of an AI suggestion that was correct (including what the AI suggested and how you verified the result).
- Give one example of an AI suggestion that was incorrect or misleading (including what the AI suggested and how you verified the result).

## 3. Debugging and testing your fixes

- How did you decide whether a bug was really fixed?
- Describe at least one test you ran (manual or using pytest)  
  and what it showed you about your code.
- Did AI help you design or understand any tests? How?

## 4. What did you learn about Streamlit and state?

- How would you explain Streamlit "reruns" and session state to a friend who has never used Streamlit?

## 5. Looking ahead: your developer habits

- What is one habit or strategy from this project that you want to reuse in future labs or projects?
  - This could be a testing habit, a prompting strategy, or a way you used Git.
- What is one thing you would do differently next time you work with AI on a coding task?
- In one or two sentences, describe how this project changed the way you think about AI generated code.
